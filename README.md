**Why is this application different than using a .bat file?**
- Check current version of filter list to see if update is required (checks local to server md5 hash before downloading)
- Doesn't required a 3rd party extracting software (nxFilter-auto-update can extract .tar.gz file)
- Reduces downtime by pre-download shalla filter list and extracting it before stopping service and updating it

**Arguments**
- f = force update (if you don't want the md5 hash check)
